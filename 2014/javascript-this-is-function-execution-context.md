#JavaScript this is the function execution context

`this` keyword in JavaScript is confusing for a lot developers who come from OO world (i.e. Java, C++ or C#)as they assume it should behave exactly the same as in other languages for example `this` in C++. Actually `this` keyword in JavaScript is totally different from `this` in most OO languages.

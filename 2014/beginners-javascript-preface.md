# Beginners' JavaScript - Preface

## My Understanding of JavaScript Key Elements
JavaScript is not a complicated programming language, but is also not a simple one. It supports object based programming, dynamic typing and functional programming. So, it is powerful. A lot developers who come from C/C++, Java or C# world may feel not comfortable when they first time playing with JavaScript. Yes, due to the design and historical issue, JavaScript has some bad parts which we should try to avoid; but it has a lot [Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) which worth to learn. 
 
I also felt uncomfortable when I began to learn JavaScript, some concepts just conflicted with existing understandings in my mind. For example, at the beginning, I just thought `this` keyword has the same meaning as the one in C++ or C#. But later on I found it was a mistake, a big mistake. 
 
Actually, unlike C++ has extraordinary syntax and rules (I am not saying C++ is bad, but it should support old code and new features which makes it complex), JavaScript has very few language features. So, after years of intermittently learning of JavaScript, I would like to share how I understand JavaScript language key elements in following posts. Maybe it is not the best way to learn JavaScript, but just show you some reference. Hope it helps.

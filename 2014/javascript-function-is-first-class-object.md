#JavaScript function is first class object

What is first class object? A definition from Wikipidea:
>In programming language design, a first-class citizen (also object, entity, or value) in a given programming language is an entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as a parameter, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable.

##function has characters which a JavaScript Object has
